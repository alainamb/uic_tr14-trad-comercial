# EDF Renewables Expands Clean Energy Portfolio in Mexico

EDF Renewables, a leading international developer of renewable energy projects, announces significant expansion of its clean energy operations in Mexico, reinforcing its commitment to the country's energy transition and establishing itself as a major player in North America's renewable energy sector.

## Major Milestones in Mexican Renewable Energy Development

EDF Renewables has achieved several significant milestones in Mexico, demonstrating the company's long-term commitment to the region and its ability to deliver large-scale renewable energy projects in competitive emerging markets.

### Bluemex Solar Facility Commissioned in Sonora

EDF Renewables has successfully commissioned Bluemex, its first solar power plant in Mexico. This 119.6 MWp photovoltaic facility is located in the northern Mexican state of Sonora, one of the country's regions with highest solar irradiation levels.

Occupying over 340 hectares, the Bluemex solar photovoltaic power plant comprises advanced PV modules supplied by Canadian Solar Inc. The facility utilizes bifacial photovoltaic cell technology, which captures sunlight from both sides of the panel, maximizing energy generation efficiency in the desert environment.

The solar project was awarded in 2016 through the second long-term auction of supply certificates and power purchase agreements for clean energy held by Mexico's Federal Electricity Commission (CFE). Under this competitive tender, the facility secured a 15-year fixed tariff, providing long-term revenue stability and demonstrating the economic viability of solar energy in Mexico.

The construction of the solar power plant created 900 jobs during the building phase, with the operation and maintenance of the facility creating 18 permanent local positions. This job creation underscores the economic benefits that renewable energy projects bring to local communities beyond their environmental contributions.

### Bii Stinu Wind Farm Delivers Clean Energy to Major Corporations

EDF Renewables has also commissioned the 164 MW Bii Stinu wind farm through its Mexican subsidiary, EDF EN Mexico. Located in a highly favorable wind region of Oaxaca in southern Mexico, the facility joins EDF's existing La Mata Ventosa wind farm (67.5 MW) in the same area, creating a significant renewable energy hub in the region.

The Bii Stinu wind farm comprises 82 turbines with 2 MW unit capacity provided by Spanish manufacturer Gamesa. The facility is owned jointly by EDF EN Mexico and the Mitsui & Co. Ltd group through its Mexican subsidiary, MIT Renewables Mexico, representing a successful international partnership model for renewable energy development.

The electricity generated by the Bii Stinu facility is purchased by a consortium of international and Mexican corporations—including Arcelor Mittal Steel Lázaro Cárdenas, Walmart Mexico, Grupo Modelo, Grupo Herdez, and Continental Automotive Guadalajara—under 15-year power purchase agreements. This corporate commitment demonstrates the growing demand from major industrial players for reliable, long-term renewable energy supplies to meet their sustainability objectives.

## Strategic Alignment with Global Renewable Energy Goals

EDF Renewables first entered the Mexican market in 2001 and currently operates 1 GW of combined wind and solar energy capacity in the country. This expansion into Mexico's solar energy segment represents another step forward toward achieving the objectives outlined in the EDF Group's Cap 2030 strategy, which aims to double the company's renewable energy capacity worldwide to 50 GW net between 2015 and 2030.

> "With these large-scale Latin American projects, EDF Renewables has demonstrated its ability to bring projects to fruition in these promising and competitive markets alongside local partners possessing proven contextual knowledge," said Antoine Cahuzac, Senior Executive Vice President in Renewable Energies of EDF. "Our future 1.4 GW wind and solar energy portfolio will make a significant contribution toward the EDF Group's goal of doubling its renewable capacity by 2030."

EDF Renewables is now one of the largest renewable energy developers in North America, with 16 GW in gross wind, solar, and storage capacity being developed across the United States, Canada, and Mexico. Its development focuses primarily on wind and solar photovoltaic power. The company maintains significant capabilities in offshore wind power and other renewable energy sectors including distributed energy and energy storage solutions.

EDF Renewables operates predominantly in Europe and North America but continues to expand by establishing strong positions in promising emerging regions such as Brazil, Chile, China, India, South Africa, and the Middle East.
