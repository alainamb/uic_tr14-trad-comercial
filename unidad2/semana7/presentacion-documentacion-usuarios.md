<summary>üìù Transcripci√≥n Completa de la Entrevista</summary>

**Alaina:** My name is Alaina and this is a Localization Industry Expert Q&A.

**Alaina:** So we are very fortunate to be joined by Monika Aeschbacher, who is the global content architect with NetApp. At NetApp, Monika is responsible for terminology alignment, governance, and she manages a centralized term database that is used by customers and a network of 10,000 employees. She has a bachelor of translation in German, French and Spanish from the Zurich School of Applied Linguistics and a master of business administration from Santa Clara University. And in speaking Monika with Edith Bendermacher, she spoke of your role as one of sort of a terminology steward, which I thought was a really interesting way of talking about terminology. So we are very happy to have you here today and we thank you for your time.

**Monika:** Thank you, Alaina. Coming back to terminology steward, I've been called many names, so sometimes I call myself the watchdog of terminology, sometimes the guardian angel of terminology. Recently requester of terminology called me, ‚ÄúShe who is the namer of all things at NetApp.‚Äù While this title was a little bit long, I rather liked it. 

**Alaina:** That is a really great title.

**Monika:** So you can see the powers that come with terminology stewardship.

**Alaina:** Yeah, and that's great because terminology is so important to translation processes and efficiency, so I'm glad people are recognizing you with appropriate titles. So we have today some questions that were prepared by students. We had the good fortune of having the globalization team from NetApp come and speak with us at MIIS back in February of this year of 2018. And so based on that presentation and just on our studies in terminology management, they prepared some questions. So I'll start with the first one. How can successful terminology play a role in promoting company goals?

**Monika:** At NetApp in the last few years, we tended to create names that are rather descriptive and we create these names for our product, services and solutions. We actually look at the names from a customer perspective. A name should give a customer pretty good idea of what an offering's all about. So think about our All Flash Storage arrays. They are called All Flash FAS, so the customer already knows this is the latest and greatest technology. Then we also have a backup solution in the cloud. We have a whole portfolio of cloud data services now and this backup solution is called Cloud Backup. Again, not much guesswork to be done by the customer. And then we have, for example, a hyperconverged infrastructure solution and this solution is called NetApp HCI.

**Alaina:** Cool. So a wide suite of products that people are able to access more easily because there's consistent terminology used around them.

**Monika:** That's correct. Consistency is key and consistency across content types is absolutely necessary. So our customers find the content easily independently of the type of content they're looking for. They might be looking for a data sheet to have a tech specifications or product manual or even an infographic blog post or knowledge base articles. For all these content types, we strive at NetApp to use our names and technical terms consistently, and we think because we don't know what content customer interacts with first, if it's support content or sales content or marketing content or even detailed technical presentation, we really think that consistency influences the purchase decision.

**Alaina:** Great. So that's something that when the NetApp team was over at MIIS, they talked about sort of terminology being something that contributes to the larger goal of sales and it sounds like that's a way that that's achieved.

**Monika:** Absolutely.

**Alaina:** So our next question, I was surprised by the size of the team that's being managed over there. We heard that you have 10,000 employees who are potentially accessing this terminology information. Since the larger the team, the greater the potential for redundancy, disorganization and obscurity, what are some of the best practices or tools to ensure efficiency and agile handling of what must be an incredible amount of information and terminology?

**Monika:** Terminology is just another step in the localization process chain. Of course it's at the beginning and if we introduce a new product in a product launch, there is usually time for content to get ready. This content then is already shared with our teams and our linguists harvest new names and terms. They make a decision about whether they want to translate them or leave them as ‚Äúdo not translate‚Äù terms, and then they add these names and terms to our terms database before even translation begins.

**Alaina:** And then you also have, it sounds like, term management that is happening before even the English content is being written.

**Monika:** That's right, yes. So that's key. An additional piece in the puzzle is terminology alignment, the use of the same names, terms, abbreviations with the same meaning in all English content because as you can imagine, we are a US company, so 95% of our content is created in English and then translated into all those languages. Terminology governance helps with change management and maintenance of our internal monolingual terms database, which is accessible companywide. So that's where those 10,000 people come in, but they have viewing privileges.

**Alaina:** Wow, and so just thinking about the different places where terminology is coming from, and you did a wonderful GALA presentation as well in March of this year I believe, on terminology management and the three sources of new terms. And one of the new sources of terms was when your team acquires a new company. So when your company acquires a new organization or a license for a new technology from an outside vendor, their terminology might be different from yours. How do you address harmonization issues?

**Monika:** Yes, this observation is very correct. So I remember a few years back we acquired SteelStore technology from Riverbed Technologies and we absolutely had to rename this technology because it would've been confusing. We didn't acquire whole company but really just a license to use this product. So we gave it a completely new name, it was called AltaVault at the time. So that was a renaming exercise and then of course in old existing product documentation that we also received with this product, we had to update all of this. We usually don't update anything in old content, so we just use the new terms or new names in new content.

**Alaina:** Interesting.

**Monika:** Then over time the old content is obsoleted and we don't have those occurrences of old terminology and old content anymore.

**Alaina:** Are you seeing where you have to update user interfaces then alongside of that update of user manuals and whatnot?

**Monika:** Yes, that goes hand in hand. So we just recently had a name that was also changed and then we decided we have to keep the abbreviation that's used in the user interface for some time or we at least have to then explain that this old abbreviation designates now this new name or stands for this new name. So that can be a little bit tricky and also to keep track of all of this.

**Alaina:** How do you keep track of it all?

**Monika:** In this case, we work with product managers, product marketing managers, and then we actually implement the terms in our DITA authoring tool. So these are implemented as variables and then they're pulled from there and not only now term database. So let me just also come back to what happens when we acquire a company. That was the case. We acquired a few smaller companies, but the larger company that was acquired a couple of years ago is called SolidFire. And what we did then we reached out to their teams and realized that they had quite an extensive glossary put together that described not only their technology but also their business processes. So together with people who were in the know about SolidFire technology, we weeded out terms that we didn't need and that weren't pertinent anymore for NetApp. And then we looked at the remaining terms and again in agreement with the terminologists from our technical documentation team, we then decided which terms should be added to the terms database. In this case, this is also interesting because over time the SolidFire name it seems will be phased out completely and then we might only keep parts of a name. For example, we have something called NetApp SolidFire Element OS operating system. You can see that is very, very complicated. So we'll standardize and zoom in on the NetApp element.

**Alaina:** Wow. So when you're looking at some sort of harmonization like that and then you have so many departments and a vast number of people that you have to reach with those sorts of terminology changes, how do you ensure that your workflow and communication are scalable and that they're effective as well?

**Monika:** Yes. That's where the monthly meetings come in with editors from different departments. So we meet and align on the use of new terminology and changes in terminology. We then update our internal terms database and also all downstream operations are informed when our naming committee, which sits in marketing, introduces any new names or name changes. So the naming committee not just introduces new names, there are rules about the submission of new name. The new name must already have been approved by management. The new name must also be included in our taxonomy so we know exactly what we are naming, and from my standpoint, I represent the content creators and editors and I provide input from a linguistic standpoint to the naming committee. So the names meet basic grammar rules and we really say what we want to say with those names. That's sometimes not so easy because people tend not to hyphens and things like that, or people just like to add noun after noun after noun and then we have to say, well let's see what modifies what and is this really the intent of this name?

**Alaina:** Very interesting. It sounds like with the systems that you have in place, you're able to avoid that redundancy that a student mentioned earlier and also that your system is very intentional.

**Monika:** Absolutely, yes. We have processes in place so we can avoid that. We have, for example, abbreviations that mean two different things. We actually discard any abbreviations that are only consistently of two letters because these are very confusing. So yes.

**Alaina:** Interesting. So what does a typical terminology meeting look like for you?

**Monika:** We prepare really well for those meetings. We collect and if I say we, so that's anything that we hear about as a content creator or editor or technical writer. So we collect the terms and names for weeks actually before an alignment meeting even takes place. And then a centralized list of these names and terms is sent out for comment a couple of days before the meeting to everybody who will participate in the meetings. Then people comment on those terms in the list and those comments are again added to the list. And in the actual meeting we make decisions if we are in a position to make decisions. But if we realize for example that we need additional information or that there is no agreement, then we assign an action item to the best positioned person who can run with this task, and this person then reaches out to a subject matter expert, does some further research and then comes back with their findings and we make definitive decision in the subsequent meeting. We also record our meetings. Sounds like something simple, but if you think about that, we also have a terminologist or actually two terminologists in India. It's really important. We try to have the terminology alignment meetings early in the morning so people in India can participate, but it's just also very good to record the meetings not only for people who are remote, but also to go back to what we discussed, if anything is not clear and we can then document our decision.

**Alaina:** It sounds like a very fun process for those who really enjoy translation and so any students that are listening to this clearly enjoy translation. It sounds like you must have some really fascinating discussions.

**Monika:** Oh, absolutely. It's funny that you mentioned that, but I look forward to, I relish those meetings. Also for some people, terminology sounds like something that's pretty dry. You really should hear those discussions. 

**Alaina:** I bet it's pretty interesting. Yeah, I'm sure because people get really passionate about what they believe something should be called.

**Monika:** So I can give you one example. We've been discussing for months if we should use ‚Äúnext generation‚Äù, such as in ‚Äúnext generation technology‚Äù only for certain products and not for other products, and we as editors we or terminologist say, it's not possible that you ban the use of a common term such as ‚Äúnext generation‚Äù. It's just not possible. Then there are people who think, oh yeah, yeah, this is because we don't want to just say everything is next generation and the debate is endless.

**Alaina:** It sounds like as well, you have a lot of different procedures or processes to achieve stakeholder buy in. So you're talking about recording meetings for example, so that anyone who wasn't able to attend it is able to go back and listen to that and understand your decision making process. So among the many internal teams you interact with, do you find that certain teams are more supportive and certain teams are less supportive of your terminology work? And do you have ideas why?

**Monika:** I would say that our learning organization, which is called NetApp University, is possibly the most supportive organization. NetApp University content creators understand that it's important to be systematic, to be consistent, to document sessions. So I would say this is absolutely what furthers and stabilizes our efforts. But then we have other departments and teams which maybe are not absolutely interested in participating our efforts because they see themselves more as consumers of terminology and therefore they don't want to invest time in terminology management and alignment efforts. So then we talk to these teams and once the team understands the importance of terminology, usually they join the cause. In my mind, a big problem is abbreviations. So people love to speak and write in abbreviations, and those just came to mind because the team that I thought of that is not very supportive of our efforts, they love to use abbreviations everywhere. However, abbreviations can be confusing. And so we train our content creators and editors to introduce an abbreviation with its full name and that's also very helpful for translators of course. And then put the abbreviation in parenthesis. And one example that I would like to give is Asymmetric Logical Unit Access. So we write this out and then we put ALUA into parenthesis, and afterwards of course at the second mention, we just use ALUA.

**Alaina:** It's interesting to think about abbreviations and acronyms because on the one hand, one of the goals of terminology management and technical communication is efficient communication. And so you would think that the abbreviation would contribute to efficient communication because it's shorter, but in the end it doesn't if it causes confusion for people who are accessing content.

**Monika:** Absolutely. And even if you think about we had long discussions to come back to those conversations we have in alignment meetings, what is an abbreviation and what is an acronym? Actually not all people agree. So that was, I thought know exactly what an acronym is and I know exactly what an abbreviation is‚Ä¶

**Alaina:** Kind of changing gears a little bit, in a company like NetApp where technology and thus terminology changes very fast, how do you keep various departments updated on time and how does the communication structure regarding constant terminology updates work?

**Monika:** Yes, that's a constant challenge. Of course, not everybody is informed who should be informed, so we always try to find new possibilities to promote the internal term database that I mentioned, which is centralized, accessible without a password actually, as long as you are in a company office or on the company virtual private network. So I thought that was also important that people don't have to bother with the login to access those terms. It's a constant challenge because our company evolves, which creates business units, and so there are new names. We always launch new services, new products, so there is quite some need for name changes or new names. And in addition to the notifications that are sent out by the naming committee that I mentioned, we also publish a monthly terminology newsletter. And it's interesting, I first introduced a newsletter in 2017, so not so long ago. And then I was thinking, okay, now I have a lot of topics that I want to write about that, let me see, what about in two years will I ever run out of topics? And it's interesting that for each month I know exactly what a topic will be. This month's topic is actually there are a few new names that we just introduced for cloud products and these names are confusing and people really need a lot of explanations on why we changed names, why we introduced some additional names, and what's the business rationale. And so the June newsletter, which will go out today is dedicated to this topic.

**Alaina:** It sounds like since you have so many different processes already in place or just well-defined and established processes, that probably helps you speed achieve the speed necessary to attend to name changes while you can also sort of come in where you're using the newsletter to achieve that stakeholder that‚Äôs ongoing and‚Ä¶

**Monika:** Right. Sometimes actually things need to, if you think about it, I mean if a product is successful, why would you change its name and it should be a pretty slow process. But in our company just recently, maybe because we grew or we have now this great cloud offering, there was just a tremendous need for new terminology. And product marketing managers in particular are thankful if they have somebody who listens to them, who knows that a name is extremely important and then also watches our consistency and promotes the name even within sales teams.

**Alaina:** Could you give us a real-life example of how terminology helps to contribute to product sales? Speaking of your product managers‚Ä¶

**Monika:** Again, coming back to the cloud data services. So we just introduced a product called Cloud Volumes, and this is a big deal because this Cloud Volumes product is actually offered via cloud provider platform. So the big three names, AWS -Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud platform. And our sales team needed to understand how this product is being offered because this is now also a new model for us. It's a different consumption model, it's a subscription model and where they came in to help with the sales of this product. The product marketing manager and I teamed up and the newsletter actually included an interview about the background of this name, and what we are naming, and why this is important in how we go to market. So the newsletter was this interview with the product marketing manager and then it went out to all the sales team.

**Alaina:** Cool. It's a cool name. Cloud Volumes.

**Monika:** Speaks volumes.

**Alaina:** Yes, it does. Wonderful. So it sounds like a lot of meetings that you're doing in order to come up with names, a lot of really positive collaboration. As a terminology manager, what are some of your other day-to-day tasks?

**Monika:** Yes, I already mentioned a few tasks. You're right. I mean there are a lot of meetings. Again, it seems like terminology management sounds like something that's really boring and hard to do on a day-to-day basis. You have to be very methodical and detail oriented. But I see myself actually as being pretty paranoid about two things. Collaboration, collaboration, collaboration. So really talking to people and then also have this detail orientedness and really care about an apostrophe and the hyphen. And so the day-to-day includes updating the terms database, but also being available for people to talk to me or to call a meeting if this is needed because sometimes people don't agree. So recently I was just called upon to find a way to reconcile different stakeholders and advise them what the best process would be to align on a name.

**Alaina:** So those soft skills then as well.

**Monika:** Absolutely. Yeah.

**Alaina:** So since you have a specific team that generates content, what is the connection between your content strategy and terminology management?

**Monika:** I've been thinking about that. I wouldn't say that terminology management is part of a content strategy, but then of course it's still extremely important if you look at a tactical level because as consistent terminology enables various content creators in various departments to produce content that is understandable and stays the same across various dimensions. So I would say that the consistent use of terminology makes many downstream operations easier. And last but not least, this includes localization.

**Alaina:** Do you have any comments on localization and terminology management, how those kind of go hand in hand?

**Monika:** I do have that. That's something that in my mind that we are actually trying to do now that we reconcile our multi-term database, which is multilingual obviously, with our monolingual term database and that we have a process to have one source of truth basically. So everything that's in our monolingual database is also in our multilingual terms database. And then our monolingual terms database could be possibly augmented with additional terms that are not so relevant for English speaking folks. So yeah, we just still think about how we can best address that.

**Alaina:** So there's always work to be done in terminology management, which I find to be really inspiring and motivational because if you enjoy the work, it's nice to know that there will always be sort of things that you can do and ways that you can keep up with changes in technologies and things like that.

**Monika:** Yes. I mean, coming back to the title, my current title is Global Content Architect, and we were joking with my peer here at NetApp and I said, well, I really want to be called CTO. And then he said, well, why do we want to be called CTO? I said, well, I want to be the Chief Terminology Officer. I think it's something pretty strategic, but maybe that's for another day.

**Alaina:** Yeah. Hey, it draws attention to terminology management and it sounds like you have some really awesome titles. So Global Content Architect, Chief Terminology Officer, and She Who Names All Things. Monika, thank you so much for your time today. Is there any final advice you would have for students who are looking to get involved with terminology management?

**Monika:** I would say take terminology seriously. Don't make decisions yourself. Look what's out there. Find the person who is really knowledgeable about what you're naming and make sure you listen to their advice.

**Alaina:** We appreciate it. Thanks again.
