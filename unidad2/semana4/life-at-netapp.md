# Life at NetApp

At NetApp, we foster a high-achieving culture where employees are empowered to own their careers. We welcome unique perspectives, fueling a collaborative environment that sparks innovation and drives excellence. Whether you're shaping the future of data and AI or closing new deals, you'll find purpose and possibility here.

## What we value

Our values inform every decision we make—from customer interactions and social causes to designing solutions and supporting our employees. At NetApp, living these values is essential.

### Put the customer at the center
You don't become a deeply trusted, indispensable partner without listening to customers, walking in their shoes, and propelling your orbit with a strong point of view.

### Care for each other and our communities
Caring for each other and our communities takes large doses of humility and kindness—mixed with building deep, authentic connections and topped with an unwavering commitment to collaboration.

### Think and act like owners
Showing up with our A game, being accountable, and acting with speed and integrity are the keys to unlocking the sense of ownership that's necessary to create the future.

### Build belonging every day
By embedding belonging into every decision that we make, we open the door to other voices, different perspectives, and most important, our true potential for innovation.

### Embrace a growth mindset
We step out of our comfort zone even when it's scary and learn from both our failures and our successes. This keeps us from stepping into the dreaded fixed-mindset quicksand.

## NetApp puts people first

Inclusion and belonging are woven into our culture, values, and business practices. We're a collection of people from around the world with our own individual stories, but we all share the drive to create innovative, world-class products.

> "We believe that the strongest and most creative teams have the best talent, are unified in purpose, and diverse in thought and background representing the customers and communities we serve."

> **George Kurian, CEO, NetApp**
