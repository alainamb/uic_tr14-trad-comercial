# Liquid Death

## ABOUT US

Liquid Death will not kill you. But make no mistake, our infinitely recyclable cans of premium low-calorie beverages will absolutely murder your thirst. And it doesn't stop there. After twerking on your thirst's grave, these ruthless cans will actually donate a portion of the proceeds to help kill plastic pollution.

Why? For centuries, all the funniest and coolest marketing and branding was only done for unhealthy products like beer, fast food, candy, and junk food. But those days are over.

Soon, Liquid Death will use health and humor to conquer the world and make all beverages Liquid Death for eternity. At which point we'll finally begin turning the human race into flesh batteries to power our giant marketing robots.

But enough about us and our boring story.

## THE FLASKET
$830.00

**Select Color:** Matte Black | Silver

### DESCRIPTION (Silver)

Finally, you can drink straight from a casket. For centuries, the idea of drinking from a casket seemed like only a dream. In the late 18th century, Sir Killington Von Murderberg invented a very long straw with a drill bit attached that allowed people to merely sip from caskets but not actually guzzle. That's why we’re proud to announce that after years of R&D in our Advanced Coffin Development Team, we're launching the Flasket. Which is a play on words combining "Flask" and "Casket."

### DESCRIPTION (Matte Black) 

After years in the making, our Advanced Coffin Development Team is pleased to announce the latest innovation in drinking straight from the casket: the Flasket in Matte Black.

It's a flasket. It's a casket. And now it comes in all black. This incredible advancement has already won Invention of the Year for the next 5 years and is almost sold out. Get yours while you still can.

### DETAILS

- Custom molded stainless steel flask
- 5.7” tall x 2.4” wide x 1.1” deep, 6oz capacity
- Hand-washing is recommended to maintain finish
