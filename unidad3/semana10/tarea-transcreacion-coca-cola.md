# Coca-Cola Transcreation Report

Coca-Cola is an iconic brand when it comes to advertising. The product was named in the late 19th century for its two main ingredients (then): extract of coca leaves and kola nuts. Early on, the brand needed to reposition itself away from being associated with cocaine into a family brand. (The Snopes article [Did Coca-Cola Ever Contain Cocaine?](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/cocaine-coca-cola) explains this early history.)

For this assignment you'll be transcreating a Coca-Cola advertisement. You'll pick a advertisement to transcreate, and produce a report for marketing executives on the potential transcreations for the ad.
