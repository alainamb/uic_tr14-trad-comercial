# Análisis de Campañas y Anuncios

[Introduction]

## Actividad 1: "Campaigns of the World"

The site "[Campaigns of the World](https://campaignsoftheworld.com/)" collects unique and creative advertisement campaigns from around the world. Go to the site and do some exploration. Find an ad campaign that speaks to you - preferably with the types of print and digital media we're exploring this week. Then do a post in our Ad Campaigns channel on team about what you found.

Your post should address the prompts in the post template below.

```
Subject: Illustrative Title for the Post

Description: Share details about the company/product for which the campaign was designed

Callout text: Name any key taglines associated with the ad

Critical Analysis
- Why did you pick the campaign?
- Do a linguistic analysis of the tagline. What about the campaign is emotionally resonant?  What challenges would this campaign present in translation?
- Give the transcreation a shot. What are some potential options for the transcreation of the ad?

Link: Share a link to the post you found on Campaigns of the World

## Actividad 2: Analyzing transcreated ad campaigns

Pick a product that has well-recognized ads. Find examples of the ads that they use in different markets, such as in English-, Spanish- and French-speaking markets. What is the link among the ads? Is there a central concept that is shared while the actual campaigns are targeted to the specific market? Is there no link between the ads at all?

Share about what you found with the class.

- Corona - Por qué decimos 'mande' campaign
