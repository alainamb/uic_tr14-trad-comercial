## Descripci√≥n del Proyecto

En el art√≠culo "[Predictions for how the language industry might evolve in the next 5 to 10 years](https://locessentials.com/blog/2024/09/19/predictions-for-how-the-language-industry-might-evolve-in-the-next-5-to-10-years)" escribo: "The language industry will see a significant rebranding, focusing on a more creative and market-driven approach to content localization. Rather than attempting to adapt a single source text to fit different markets, companies will increasingly design content from scratch for each market based on a central concept. This creative shift will simplify localization processes, enabling companies to deliver tailored, market-specific products more efficiently, avoiding the ‚Äúone-size-fits-all‚Äù approach. This trend is exemplified by companies like [WE ARE VERY](https://www.linkedin.com/company/we-are-very-inc/), which emphasizes market-specific product design over traditional translation and adaptation efforts."

For this assignment, your project is the adaptation of contents by [Whatnot](https://www.whatnot.com), a livestream shopping platform that's changing interactive e-commerce, with a community-driven marketplace for discovering and purchasing collectibles in real time. Whatnot represents an innovative business model combining social and commerce. Whatnot is featured on startupsavant.com - thirty-second in their list of [100 Top Startups to Watch in 2025](https://startupsavant.com/startups-to-watch).

This adaption project has a twist. Instead of translating or localizing the content, you will identify a central concept from it that you can use as the basis for designing a digital campaign with SEO for Whatnot. The scenario is that Whatnot has approached you for a digital campaign designed specifically for its potential market in Mexico. They've given you the materials from their "[Labubus on Whatnot](https://alainamb.github.io/uic_tr14-trad-comercial/unidad3/semana11/whatnot-labubus.html)" project as inspiration. 

You'll need to identify Whatnot's best potential audiences in Mexico and a strong central concept from the Labubus on Whatnot project that you can take as inspiration for the content you'll design. You'll conduct SEO analysis so you know what key words and phrases to use throughout your content, in blog post headers and meta-data descriptions, categories and tags, and as hashtags, etc. Next you'll present a design plan in which you share three texts that you've designed - a blog post and two social media posts for different platforms - and discuss how your previous research shows up in your plan. This part of your plan should also address how content has been tailored to the different platforms. You'll need to include a conclusion to your report, along with a works consulted section.
