### How a Pop Mart Toy Became a Household Name: The Rise of Labubu

From celebrities to your next-door neighbors, the conversation and craze of Labubu is undeniable. What started in 2015 as an inspiration of monsters from Eastern European and Nordic mythology, these toys were widely under the radar for nearly ten years until BLACKPINKâ€™s Lisa was spotted sporting them on her bags in late 2024, with David Beckham and Madonna sharing them across their socials shortly after. 

Today, Labubus are flying off the shelves and onto our backpacks, handbags, major auctions, and wherever else our hearts desire. While these fuzzy monsters are increasingly difficult to purchase in-store, weâ€™ve seen a massive demand for them across Whatnot since March, with a 300% increase in GMV month-over-month, making it one of our fastest-growing categories.

#### A Moment Across Categories

What makes this emerging trend so unique on Whatnot is its cross-category appeal, extending from toys to fashion. From sneakers to luxury sellers, weâ€™re seeing a significant uptick in how sellers are leveraging this moment to expand their audiences and attract more buyers. In fact, buyers from categories such as beauty, womenâ€™s fashion, streetwear, and even electronics are coveting Labubus. Itâ€™s not just a one-size-fits-all; Labubus are for everyone.

#### Sellers Rising to the Occasion

Many sellers have taken it upon themselves to incorporate Labubus into their own shows and see for themselves how their communities keep coming back for more.

What started as a test exploded into a $240,000 monthly revenue stream. The Chalice team expects the Labubu craze to continue well into the year. Today, they strategically offer two Labubus boxes per show to manage demand and not outstrip supply.

- **[coolkicks](https://www.whatnot.com/user/coolkicks)** - Recently started incorporating Labubus into their shows and quickly realized that the demographics who are Labubus-obsessed also love sneakers and streetwear. The toys are flying off the shelves in CoolKicksâ€™ two brick-and-mortar stores and during their live Whatnot shows. They donâ€™t expect the hype to slow down anytime soon, as sales continue to increase by the day. 

- **[36samplesale](https://www.whatnot.com/user/36samplesale?referringSource=autocomplete)** - Started by sharing a variety of Labubu-themed videos on our social media â€” from unboxings and skits to fun tips â€” all designed to drive traffic to their Whatnot shows. This strategy has significantly helped them reach new audiences: two of their recent social videos featuring Labubu reached over 400,000 views within just two days. Riding that momentum, they continued posting Labubu-related content, which garnered over 50,000 impressions on Instagram and significantly boosted our accountâ€™s conversion rate. Labubu became the hook that introduced people to our Whatnot profile and Instagram channel.

While Labubu continues to make a name for itself, we donâ€™t expect this trend to fade anytime soon. If youâ€™re looking to broaden your audience and find new ways to engage with your buyers, check out these **[sellers](https://www.whatnot.com/search?query=labubu&searchVertical=LIVESTREAM&referringSource=autocomplete)** who have jumped on the trend.

Thereâ€™s Labubu. Thereâ€™s Lafufu. And then thereâ€™s whatever this is... @cobblerconcierge

**Video - closed captions:**
This isn't the weirdest thing we've been asked to fix. He 
said he wanted to join a Labubus. I said, I'll see what I 
can do. So to help him achieve his goal of hanging with the 
Labubu fam. We're going to create what we call a D ring.
Now we're trimming it. The measurements are really crucial
because we want it to look as if it already had this already
attached. The cementing allows it to hold fastened to the
folding that's going to happen when we reattach it to the new
ring and then hand stitch it to the Now, this is going to get
hand stitched. We have to hand stitch it because if you use
any machinery, you could damage the soft nature of the fur.
Each one of them now. May the other Labubus accept him.
